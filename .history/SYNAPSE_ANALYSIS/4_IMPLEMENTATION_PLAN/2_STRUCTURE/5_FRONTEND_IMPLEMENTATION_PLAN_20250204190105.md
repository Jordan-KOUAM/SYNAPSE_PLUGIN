imagine you could click one button and
clone an entire software application
okay we're not quite there yet but this
is definitely where the future is
heading and today I want to show you in
this video my workflow for the currently
fastest way to basically clone an entire
software application and we're going to
be using two tools for that so one is
copy coder which you can see on the
screen right now and the second tool to
actually build the application is going
to be cursor okay so let's go okay so
the first thing we want to do is
actually just get a screenshot of what
ever app it is that we want to clone so
we could for example go into let's say
music YouTube YouTube music and just
take a screenshot of the front end here
and save this so this could be one
option and if we wanted to clone that we
could just be you know dragging in the
the screenshot here and then clicking on
generate prompt but let's I want to show
you another option too which is also
pretty awesome so I can go on a site
like dribbble.com which has a bunch of
different designs right then I can type
in something like simple web app or
maybe even um
dashboard and then I can like go through
these designs and just pick one that I
like and that I want to build so maybe I
have an idea for some app that I want to
build and I see a design which has like
the similar components which I think my
final app should have and then I'll just
take that right so let's just go with
the first one here for now here this
seems to be some sort of app about
housing okay it say it has like projects
analytics reports so it seems to be some
some app where you can I guess manage
maybe your construction sites or
something or like your different
properties something like that anyways
it looks good so let's screenshot
it I'll screenshot it
here and let's use this one now so I'm
going to take the screenshot here put it
into copy coder and then what I can
right now there's only one option it's
web applications there's going to be
other things coming here but I'm going
to select this web applications and then
just click generate prompt and what it's
doing now it's basically analyzing the
image very deeply and trying to like
figure out all of the components within
that image and like the colors and the
Styles and based on that analysis it
will create a very detailed prompt so
we're going to see in a sec when it
comes up with that prompt okay The
Prompt is here you can see uh generated
prompt if I scroll through it this is
the entire prompt here and it looks very
detailed and it's an analysis of the
screenshot that we just pasted okay so
before we copy this let's go into cursor
but let's open up cursor here and I
already have an empty project opened up
here and what I want to do first is I
just want to create a nextjs skeleton
and also add some Shaden components into
it just so that we have like this
framework that we can build on so I'm
going to paste these commands here which
so this one is to create the next xjs
project and this one is to add shaten
components which are beautiful UI
components okay we just select default
on everything and then for the import
Alias we're going to um do yes and hit
tab there and then hit enter so now it's
installing the nextjs stuff cool now
it's installing the Shad CN stuff we're
just going to hit enter on everything
too okay now it's done so we have our
project skeleton here so these are like
all this is like the framework and all
of the dependencies and all of that we
don't need to care too much about it
because anyways we're going to use AI to
to code this so I'm going to hit command
I to open up the composer in cursor
which is the you know the AI feature to
write all of the code so now I'm going
to head into copy coder again and get
this initial prompt and copy it and go
into the composer and let's paste that
here and hit enter so it's going to get
straight to work and start building this
application okay so it says let's create
the CRM dashboard with so it's like a M
dashboard with sales Pipeline and budget
analytics and it started creating all of
these components and all of these files
already it now ask would you like me to
continue with the remaining components
what you have to know is this first
prompt is to generate the initial page
of it so basically only the thing that
you see on the screenshot right now is
what this first prompt does and
sometimes when there's a lot on the
initial page it will take like two or
three prompts to actually do that so in
this case it says would you like me to
continue with the remaining component
it basically it couldn't create
everything in one prompt because you
know these AIS they're like limited in
how much of a token window they allow
and here it's limited and all we have to
do is just type yes would you like me to
continue type yes and then it continues
to add the remaining components that are
missing for this initial page okay so
it's creating the deals table component
and the metric component and then it's
updating the main page layout now so now
it says this completes the basic CR CRM
dashboard implementation
once you see this something like saying
like that it basically means that this
initial page and the initial dashboard
is completed and it'll ask you would you
like me to explain any part in detail or
make any adjustments so for now that's
not needed we just run this and have a
look at it so we're going to run this
with npn run def to run this on our
local machine and it's going to give you
this link which you can open up in your
browser and we're going to have a look
at what it says okay so this is normal
that they can be one or two build errors
it's with like this prompt is optimized
but you still sometimes get one or two
build errors which is already a lot
better than with than if you were to
build this from scratch and usually with
just pasting the screenshot it will fix
this so let's just paste this and
usually it's just like one error that or
like in this case it's a missing
component here that we need to install
so let's install this let hit this and
then we just install it here okay uh we
need to
add this to so let's try this again add
Legacy peer depths okay so we're going
to install this now this should work all
right so this package is installed and
it also updated something here okay so
let's accept this and then we're going
to head back and there we go so now you
see okay this is just a small hydration
error doesn't matter you can see this
dashboard we just created basically a
copy of this and it's like pretty much
it's reactive and it looks great it has
look it even has these like these deals
here like in the in the original image
like these deals here and this dashboard
so it looks pretty awesome already like
a pretty good copy but what you'll
notice is that this is only this first
page right the other Pages don't work if
I click on it they don't exist yet so
this is where we're going to go back
into copy coder and this is where the
step two comes into play we're going to
hit generate page structure and what
this does is it analyzes the image again
and extracts all of the different pages
and basically creates a prompt so that
you can create all of the other Pages
too so okay this prompt here is now
generated we're going to copy that for
cursor and head back into cursor and
just paste it into the composer again so
what this prompt does is it's going to
let you create all of the other Pages
now and because that's a lot of work it
also won't be able to do it in one
prompt because again the tokens are
limited and it just won't be able to do
it all in one go currently hope like in
the future that's going to be possible
but currently it's going to create it
bit by bit but what this prompt does so
well is that it lays it out for you so
that it's just very easy you just only
need to hit accept and as long as it
asks you would you like me to continue
just hit yes so just keep hitting yes
when it asks you that and it'll just
keep building for you until it's done
here it in the first prompt it created
the shared layout component and the
projects page which are these this
projects page I guess and then in the
second prompt it continued with the
analytics page so let's accept that and
let's continue again would you like me
to continue with the reports page yes it
even lists what will be included inside
okay extensions page continue with
extensions page yes continue so yeah
this is just going to get faster and
faster over time I mean it feels a bit
like like we're in the beginning of the
internet days where you like sometimes
had to you know wait until the website
is loading this is like the same thing
right now it's just a bit slow with
these new technologies but it's just
going to get faster and faster so did it
ask for yeah would you like me to
continue with the company's page yes
continue with that okay would you like
me to create the people's page next yes
okay so it says let's create a People
page to to complete our route structure
so this is going to be the last one okay
so it gave us a bit of a summary here
this completes all the main routes for
the CRM dashboard here's what is
contained and then it asks me would you
like me to add any existing but since
it's completed now it's fine we're going
to go and check it out okay so let's
check out the different
pages projects page
nice analytics page is there
perfect reports
page
extensions company's page awesome and
people's page pretty cool well this is
crazy I mean like we have an entire
front end now by just copy copy pasting
a few prompts and just hitting yes all
the time I mean okay it some of the
things here don't work yet sure like you
cannot add a new project yet but I can
go in and and just say add this
functionality same here add a person we
can go in and and add that maybe add a
settings page this is absolutely crazy
now that we can just copy a few prompts
and paste it into cursor and these
prompts guide cursor in a way that it
will create these pages with very little
build errors very minimal build errors
if you were to build this yourself in
cursor you would get a lot more build
errors and yeah this is absolutely
insane because building something like
this for a front end developer would in
the past have taken them probably a few
days to do this but now we literally did
this in less than 20 minutes and I mean
I was talking when I just like go really
fast and do this myself I do this in
under 10 minutes so yeah there we go
here check out copy cod. a and obviously
go get a cursor and then just start
trying this out take the copied
application and keep building it from
there all right bye-bye# Plan d'Implémentation Frontend des Bases de Données
